This was originally based upon "micro_httpd" by 
    Jef Poskanzer  jef@acme.com  http://www.acme.com/jef/

It has been renamed the "roxboryd" because it has become somewhat specialized.
The original license was 2-clause BSD-like.
We have put an ARTISTIC license on this code.

The key thing that roxboryd does is that it automatically creates .m3u
files when it sees .ogg/.mp3 files in a directory listing.

In addition roxboryd %-escapes all file names better.

This project is also being used as a test case for a new gForge installation
at the Government of Canada's Public Works/Government Services. (PWGSC)
