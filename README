This was originally based upon "micro_httpd" by

It has been renamed the "roxboryd" because it has become somewhat specialized.
The original license was 2-clause BSD-like.
We have put an ARTISTIC license on this code.

The key thing that roxboryd does is that it automatically creates .m3u
files when it sees .ogg/.mp3 files in a directory listing.

In addition roxboryd %-escapes all file names better.
